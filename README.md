# Telecom Call Center Efficiency Analysis

Business-oriented operational analytics case study.  
Goal: Identify inefficient call center operators, quantify business impact and prioritize actions to reduce losses.

### Context
A telecom company is losing revenue due to long waiting times, high missed call rates and inconsistent outbound call behavior from operators.

### Key Questions
- Which operators generate the highest losses?
- What metrics indicate operational inefficiency?
- Where should we focus actions first to maximize impact?

### Methodology
- Data wrangling & EDA with Python + Pandas
- Comparative operator analysis (waiting time, missed calls, outbound/ inbound ratio)
- Business impact estimation
- Prioritization based on contribution to loss

### Result (summary)
We identified a specific subset of operators with strong red flags (high waiting time + high missed calls) that should be prioritized first.  
This allows the company to improve customer experience and reduce economic loss by focusing actions in the most critical points, not by distributing effort equally.
